# Machine-learning-Projects

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you'll find my machine learning projects I've completed . These projects demonstrate my skills in data analysis, Machine learning and AI.
Note: I haven't added any end-to-end projects here yet, but I intend to do so in a different repository.  

## Projects

### Recommendation Engine with Graphs
In this project, We applied a graph-based recommendation engine to Disney+dataset.By Connecting movies and TV Shows through shared attributes, we used the Adamic Adar measure to generate personalized content recommendations.

### Stock Cost Prediction
In This project we have developed a stock cost prediction model and we build an interactive dashboard for stock analysis. We implemented stock market prediction using the LSTM model. OTOH, Plotly dash python framework for building dashboards.

### IPL_Score_prediction
This project is focused on predicting the total score in Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches based on key match factors. The project leverages machine learning techniques and explores various features such as the venue, batting team, bowling team, individual players (batsmen and bowlers), and their performances. 

The project aims to offer insights into the dynamics of IPL matches by providing accurate score predictions. It highlights feature engineering techniques, model evaluation (using metrics like R-squared, mean absolute error), and the deployment of models for practical use. The project serves as an example of how data analysis and machine learning can be applied to sports analytics for predictive modeling.
